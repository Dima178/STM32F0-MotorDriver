 - Low-pass filter

Remember to put bead in series with AVDD supply

Inrush limit:
Putting an RC filter on the gate of the reverse polarity fet may be a bad idea. The gate source voltage is max 20 V of most fets. We have to ensure that the gate source voltage always stays below 20 V, and that is hard if we make a slope on the gate voltage... Both when turning it on and off.
